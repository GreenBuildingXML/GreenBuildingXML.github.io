Stephen presents an overview of a pre-release of the next generation of the [Ladybug Tools / Spider gbXML Viewer]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-2020/spider-gbxml-viewer/ ) as linked to https://gbxml.org/. ( Click the "Viewer" button at top right of the page).

### gbXML

* Overview: gbXML is the "language of buildings" ~ enables communication between many building design software tools.
* Full [XML schema]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema ) with over 500 types, elements and enumerations: [Schema GreenBuildingXML_Ver6.01.xsd]( https://gbxml.org/schema_doc/6.01/GreenBuildingXML_Ver6.01.html) 
* Comprehensive sustainable building analysis: energy, carbon, water, light, fire and costs
* Ownership and Support: www.gbxml.org and https://github.com.GreenBuildingXML


### ASHRAE Research Project ~ RP-1810 Development of reference BIM test cases for improving usage of software interoperability schemas

* Develop software test cases and validation for gbXML files

TRACE 3D Plus is a next generation building design and analysis software program that delivers faster, more accurate results through a seamless workflow that closely aligns with today's building process: https://www.trane.com/commercial/north-america/us/en/products-systems/design-and-analysis-tools/analysis-tools/trace-3d-plus.html


### TRACE 3D Plus

* Building design and analysis software
* Built on the globally recognized EnergyPlus calculation engine
* Comprehensive energy modeling and economic analysis
* Pre-configured building themes, libraries a pre-loaded and scalable templates
* Schematically configure systems in plants
* Import 3D models directly from CAD tools using Green Building XML (gbXML)

### 3. Presentation by Ben Welle ~ Director of Energy Lab - Perkins and Will 

Ben presents a demo of the the new [SPEED (Simulation Platform for Energy Efficient Design)]( https://speed.perkinswill.com/ ) web- and cloud-based software tool using gbXML. 


[<img src=./images/2020-07/speed-2020-07-12.png width=500 >]( https://vimeo.com/417768377 )

SPEED is a web-based and cloud-based energy/daylighting/solar design and simulation platform for early design developed for architects enabling a 1-day turn-around from design question to a data-driven design answer.

Features

* web-based
* Cloud based 
* Energy analysis
* Solar radiation analysis
* Sunlight hour analysis
* Shadow/Sun path analysis
* Block and stack tool
* CAD integration
* Parametric design
* Statistical analysis
* Interactive results visualization
* Artificial intelligence
* Knowledge management/Reuse

Benefits

* Enables parametric design capabilities to designers with no experience
* Generate and run hundreds or thousands of design options leveraging statistical analysis
* Artificial intelligence built in to ensure best available assumptions and data integrity
* <24 hour turn around from design questions being asked tomorrow based results to help answer them
* Easily trainable (<1 hour) with meaningful and intuitive visualizations
* $$$ savings from having in house performance analysis capabilities, less rework, etc.
* More effective collaboration with consultants
* Risk mitigation for the rapidly approaching world of performance-based contracting
